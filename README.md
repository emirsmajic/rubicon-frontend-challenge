# Rubicon Frontend Challenge

---

Live demo: https://rubicon-challenge.emsmjc.com

## Used libraries

- React Query (api calls and caching - state management)
- React Context for UI state management (buttons, theme, search)
- Axios - data fetching library
- Styled Components - CSS in JS library
- React Router - routing

## Additional info

Bootstraped with Create-React-App (I usually prefer Next.js because of file-system routing and per-page code splitting)
